No.

You won’t let me hold it for even one minute?

Nope. Not even for one second.

Come on, Kitty. You’ve got to trust me.

Wait. Wh-Wh-What’s… What’s going on with his eyes?

Oh, they’re getting bigger.

Oh, Kitty!

You got to trust him. Look at those eyes.

What?

Swamp of Infinite Sorrows?

Mountains of Misery?

The Abyss of Eternal Loneliness?

There’s something wrong with this map.

I guess there is a different terrible path for everyone.

It’s almost like the forest doesn’t want anyone to make a wish.

Well, I don’t even have a wish, but can I try?

Oh, mine says… (gasps)

Yeah. Why are you so ridiculous, dog?

What’s your story?

My story? Oh.

It’s actually a very funny story. (laughs)

Back when I was a pup,

me and my littermates lived with a family.

A family full of pranksters who liked to play hide-and-seek, and I was always it.

Pick on the little guy, am I right? (sniffs)

They tried putting me in a packing crate, a dumpster.

No matter how hard they tried, I’d always find them.

So, one day, they get creative and they put me in a sock with a rock in it.

(laughs)

And then throw me in a river.

I gnawed a hole in the sock, and I swam to the surface.

Never found them or my littermates.

So I guess I’m still it.

(laughs)

Wow.

That is the saddest funny story I’ve ever heard.

Well, joke’s on them.

That sock they put me in, I grew into it.

So, I got a great story and a free sweater out of it.

Win-win.

Dude, you didn’t win.

You of all people should have a wish.

I already have a comfy sweater and two best friends.

I got everything I could wish for.

No magic required.

It’s you that got small.

Yeah, you changed, man.

I hear he’s best friends with a dog now.

And he doesn’t even have a sword.

(laughs) Some hero.

You’ve become a scaredy-cat.

We should call him Wuss in Boots.

Ah, no, no, no, no.

(laughter)

Didn’t you hear? His new name is Pickles.

So lame.

(laughter)

Where is your litter box, Pickles?

You know what? You guys are jerks.

Which is very conflicting for me.

I’ll find my own way out. Adios.

Oh, you think you are better than us?

Without us, you will always live a life of…

Fear.

You.

I do love the smell of fear.

(sniffs) It’s intoxicating.

(hiccups) It is?

Sorry to crash the party with your past lives.

(chuckling): Or your past deaths, as I like to call them.

(echoing): I was there to witness all of them.

Each frivolous end.

But you didn’t even notice me because Puss in Boots laughs in the face of death, right?

But you’re not laughing now.

You are no bounty hunter.

You are…

Death.

And I don’t mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or in any other fancy way.

I’m Death, straight up.

And I’ve come for you, Puss in Boots.

But I’m still alive.

(chuckles) You know…

(inhales sharply) I’m not a cat person.

I find the very idea of nine lives absurd.

And you didn’t value any of them.

So, why don’t I do us both a favor and take this last one now?

That’s cheating!

Shh. Don’t tell.

Run, Puss in Boots!

Make the wish!

Go ahead, run for it.

What’s your “just right”? What’s so blasted important that you’ve got us stranded in this haunted forest?

I’m getting a family! That’s what.
